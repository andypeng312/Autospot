## Description of Project
This is a mobile app written in Swift for iOS by Andy Peng and Daniel Shafrir.
The app allows the user to drop a pin to mark the location where they parked 
their car. The app then uses the iPhone's compass and current location to point
the user to where they parked.

The user interface is a button to drop the pin and an arrow pointing toward the
car. The app was tested in Xcode's Simulator tool for all versions of the
iPhone up to the iPhone 5S and the iPad.
